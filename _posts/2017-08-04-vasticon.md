Three possible resources:

- /StaticResource
- /IFrameResource
- /HTMLResource

**StaticResource** -

creativeType="image/png" -- Displays. Clicks thru correctly. Currently the only solution.
Positioning is done with the xPostion yPosition attributes in VAST xml.
Problems with this solution?

creativeType="application/x-javascript"
Displays. Image w/ styling appears. Icon clickthru does NOT work.

**IFrameResource**
Displays. Image w/ styling appears. Icon clickthru does NOT work.

**HTMLResource** -
Displays. Image w/ styling appears. Icon clickthru does NOT work.
Note - link to an external HTML. Do not put HTML in

See conversation with Google dev [blinny][blinny-forum]
He was recommending using **\<StaticResource\>** and creativeType="application/x-javascript"

```xml
<Icon program="AdChoices" width="60" height="20" xPosition="2" yPosition="2">
<StaticResource creativeType="application/x-javascript">
<![CDATA[http://rocketnumber9.org/vast-test/blinny/icon.html
]]>
</StaticResource>
```

Conclusion... Image and js load. Icon click through is still obscured.

## Possible Fix in [IMA Player][ima-release]

In the support forum, [a google dev has said the icon problem is fixed](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/community?place=msg%2Fima-sdk%2FMHMKZ2hy8KI%2FRjMpjczHAwAJ) and a release has been made. Except - that it hasn't.
Continued pestering of their dev team is recommended. This should work. It's in the VAST 3 spec.

## Possible Solution -  Custom js solution

 create a method that used a regex to parse through the VAST, find that icon node, pick the first one, inject the javascript/display the icon. Then you can approach these player folks with a method they can just drop right into their player code and have it work out of the box.

## CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for JavaScript

This is does not appear to be immediately applicable to the problem at hand. But I was getting CORS errors when testing out tags hosted from various locations.

The VAST 3 Spec says:

In order for JavaScript video players to accept a VAST response, ad servers must include a CORS header in the http file that wraps the VAST response. The CORS header must be formatted as follows: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \<origin header value\> Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

Solution: on my personal server from where i'm pulling tags, I added this to the .htaccess file, for testing with the Google [IMA HTML5 player:][imaplayer]
**Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \"http://imasdk.googleapis.com\"**
**Header add Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true**

JWPlayer and icon - not working. Not even a discussion of it working.
