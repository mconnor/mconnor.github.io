<p>I’m learning React. Plowing through tutorials and building little things. I find myself asking if I should go deeper, or try to rebuild the same things in other frameworks - such as Vue.js or Riot.</p>

<p>Here is my crack at facebook’s <a href="https://mconnor.github.io/tic-tac-toe/">tic-tac-toe tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve consumed all of <a href="http://wesbos.com/courses">Wesbos</a> tutorials (he has a wonderful teaching style).</p>

<p>In his React course, he guides you through creating a fish store with a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a> backend. Here is my build out of the <a href="http://rocketnumber9.org/react/catchoftheday/">Catch-of-the-Day Fish</a> store.</p>

<p>I then made my way through <a href="https://learnredux.com/">Wesbos’s Redux tutorial</a>.  Redux is for handling state. This tutorial might be due for an update. Still, it is an excellent walk-through on handling state and architecting projects.</p>
