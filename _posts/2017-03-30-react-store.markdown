I'm learning React. Plowing through tutorials and building little things. I find myself asking if I should go deeper, or try to rebuild the same things in other frameworks - such as Vue.js or Riot.

Here is my crack at facebook's [tic-tac-toe tutorial][tictactoe].

I've consumed all of [Wesbos][wesbos] tutorials (he has a wonderful teaching style).

In his React course, he guides you through creating a fish store with a [Google Firebase][firebase] backend. Here is my build out of the [Catch-of-the-Day Fish][catch] store.

I then made my way through [Wesbos's Redux tutorial][wesbos-redux].  Redux is for handling state. This tutorial might be due for an update. Still, it is an excellent walk-through on handling state and architecting projects.
