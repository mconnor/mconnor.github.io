I am a front-end developer that builds applications with JavaScript/HTML5/CSS and WordPress.

I am currently diving deep with React, Vue.js, Riot.js. I've worked professionally with AngularJS on a medical education single page app.

I have almost a decade of experience working with
Flash.  I've worked on teams - merging code with Git - and as the sole lead developer.

I am based out of New Orleans.
