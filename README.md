Currently deep diving into front-end development with React.js. Moving towards full-stack development (Apollo Client,GraphQL, Prisma). I'm constantly tinkering with new technologies. I am a big fan of vanilla JS and functional programming. I'm agnostic as to frameworks, but looking for a role on a team building apps with ES6 javascript, CSS, HTML.
