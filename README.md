I am a Front-end developer with twenty years experience developing applications for the auto, pharmaceutical, entertainment, and advertising industries.

I am currently deep diving with React, React Hooks, Gatsby, unit/integration testing, and static type checking (typescript and Flow), physics based animation (React Spring).

I  am moving towards a functional style of coding - and moving towards full-stack development (Apollo Client, GraphQL, Prisma).

I have several years experience in digital advertising - developing [VAST][vast]/[VPAID][vpaid] applications and working with industry tools such as DoubleClick.

I am experienced in pushing and merging code with git, working in the command line, processing code task via ticketing systems such as Jira.

I am coming off a two year project with Crownpeak in Sandy, UT. I took over their [AdChoices][adchoices] product. A product that generated a lot of revue. I was the sole developer for the past two years - in charge of fixing bugs, adding new features and assisting clients.

I'm very motivated to build out single page applications with React... as I have done with other technologies. I have some exposure to Vue.js and I like that too. In general, I love es6 javascript and modular frameworks.

I have a test project that [can be seen here][hooks-wine-store]
And the code is available for inspection [on Github][wine-store-code]

I should be rolling out a Gatsby blog very soon.

I am currently live in New Orleans but I'm open to relocation.
