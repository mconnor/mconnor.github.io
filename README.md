# I am Michael Connor - React Native developer

I am a Frontend developer with twenty years experience developing applications for the auto, pharmaceutical, entertainment, and advertising industries. Which is to say, I was a Flash dev and now... i'm a React Native developer.

I have been working with Hybrid building a mobile marketing app for the Cannabis industry for the last couple of years. 

My current and preferred tech stack is:

- React
- ReactNative, Exponential
- Nativebase component library
- Typescript
- monorepos (yarn workspaces)
- Graphql

I live in New Orleans - the greatest city in the world. I'm a huge fan of JazzFest - which is literally just behind my backyard. 

I've traveled through Central America, Siberia (Tuva), Morocco.

I've been all in on a lot of moral challenging crushingly exhausting large scale art projects (The Temple @ Burning Man). Working through the night with power tools.

I ride a KLR 650 but thinking of hanging that up. 

Yet more manly (but not exclusively so) stuff, I punched a bucket-list item and worked on as a professional white water rafting guide.

Dogs and I have a mutual admiration thing going on.

I am one of those obnoxious Crossfit people.

Favorite quote: 

> The high point of civilization is that you can hate me and I can hate you but we develop an etiquette that allows us to deal with each other because if we acted solely upon our impulse we'd probably go to war.
